------ Installation ------
Only unzip the Madcrabs.zip file in your half-life folder, start Half-Life and activate Madcrabs by choosing in the menu “personalised game”

------ The beginning of the SCENARIO ------
You’ve just been hired on board of The Nostromo, a goods transport ship. It’s a lovely day. However, the dicovery of a mysterious emergency capsule drifting away in the space will change it all… 

------ A few tips ------
Start off by going through the training test which actually is a job application one; it is part of the scenario. Don’t start flat out like a nag, take your time to enjoy the surroundings. 
In this mod, the headcrabs are the main Aliens’ representatives. They are slightly brawnier than in Half-Life… They particularly infect the people they meet in order to control them and increase their own resistance. Good luck…    

------ Already finished ? ------
Well, you might say that was a bit quick. Well, that's not my fault : I did it on my own, I'm still a student and I took part in other projects at the same tims. But well, if you don't know what to do next, you can always : 
-find out the 4 different endings (homage to the wonderful game 'Deus Ex')
-find out the 10 Joystick (french) magazines lost in the ship ;
-find out the mega-crowbar (I won't give you any clue...);
-start it all again at the difficult level (goog luck)

------ Thanx ------
